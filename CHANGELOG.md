## v16.12 Sulfur 37

- Administrative tasks: importing/exporting experiments, filter and join samples, filter and drop measurements, creating and merging labels, calculating cumulated dose, changing units, scaling doses
- Non-compartmental PK: fitting exponentials, calculating elimination and absorption rates, intravenous and extra-vascular NCA,
- Compartmental PK: monocompartmental (iv and ev of orders 0, 1 and mixed; iv and order 1 ev with urine data), two-compartments (iv and ev of orders 0 and 1)
- Population PK: Bootstrapping and managing populations (merging and filtering)
- Simulating any dosing regime in an individual or population
- Simulating and fitting any generic PD profile
- PBPK: Simulating the liver flow
- Statistical tests on PKPD parameters, regression, and statistical summary
