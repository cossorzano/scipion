**Xcipion** is a data analysis framework to calculate PK, PD and PKPD models. Xcipion allows 
to execute data analysis workflows combining different analysis steps. Additionally, all steps are tracked and can be reproduced later on.

it is based on [Scipion](http://scipion.cnb.csic.es), a software tool to do image analysis in structural biology.
